Feature: Config maps form view
              As a user, I need the ability to create and edit config-maps in dev perspective.


        Background:
            Given user is at developer perspective
              And user has created or selected namespace "aut-config-map"

              And user enters name of config map as "test-config-map"
              And user enters key as "test-key"
              And user enters value as "test-value"
              And user clicks on Create button
             Then user can see "test-config-map" in ConfigMap details page
